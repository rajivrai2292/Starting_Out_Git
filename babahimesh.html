<h2> 50 min Workout </h2>
<p> I've been consistent in following the greek god program muscle building program developed by Greg O Gallagher of www.Kinobody.com for 2 years now. I must say that I've been slacking in nutrition many times by not having sufficient protein in my diet for a long time but since past 3 months I have stayed on point. I have got some good results and happy with the physique now bt not at all satisfied with it. Here is my worout routine -
</p>
<table>
<th>
<tr>
<td>Workout A</td>
<td>Workout B</td>
</tr>
</th>
<tr>
<td>Incline Bench Press</td>
<td>Weighted Chinups</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Overhead Presses with Fat Bar</td>
<td>Barbell Curls with Fat Bar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Skull Crushers</td>
<td>Single DB rows</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The above workout is the exact same workout as proposed in the GGP by kinobody.com. I also switch my exercises to provide my muscles with a fresh stimulus every 3-4 months.</p>
