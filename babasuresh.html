<h3>My Review</h3>
<p>How about using your imagination to visualize a place which strips of your identity and yor clothes. When you don't have something as fundamental as a name, a pair of clothes and hairs on your had, you loose an inherent part of your soul. Shaving of heads and attaching one's identity to a number is analogous to animals in a zoo with the only difference being that they are well fed and these inmates were asked to be alive with 3 ounces of bread a day and some watery soup. When I bought this book I thought that I was the only morbid guy interested in the topic of logotherapy(I didn't even know the meaning of this term when I began) bt as it trned out later when I did a little research about it that it was actually an international best-seller when it was published in 1946. When I read the preface of this book written by Professor from Harvard I knew I was in for something extraordinary inside this book. </p>
<p>The book doesn't just counts on the list of numerous mental, social and physical atrocities of Nazis on innocent jews but also brings to the surface some of the core feelings of the inmates which could not be given meaning by anyone other than a psychiatrist who himself has survived. The first page of the book which contains only two topics speaks to the feelings of the avarage people who don't consider themselves as heroes or fanatic individuals. This boo has changed my conception of 'being tough' by enmerating numerous times in which I would have quit my life. FOr example the thought of letting one's first child die in the womb because there were no functioning hospitals for the jews sent chills down my spine. Also the thought of seeing your wife for the last time departing to the gas chambers made my heart cry. This book made me close the page I was reading and pore deeply into the emotions of the writer on many occasions. I remember the time when I was reading about the day when Dr. Frankl coldn't slide his feet into the shoes becase they were swollen from edema and had to go into 3 feets of ice barefeet, I had tears in my eyes. This boo is a mst for any gentleman who has the slightest insination that his life is worthless and it's the time to say good bye. It woldn't leave you with a happy face but after you finish the boo you will feel deep gratitde for your life and thankful to God that yo could read this impeccable piece.</p>
